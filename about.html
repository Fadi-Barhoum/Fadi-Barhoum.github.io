                                        I am doing a master's in web science at Syrian Virtual University. I graduated from Damascus university as a software engineer.
                                        I have been interested in the web for many years, which is why I chose to study for a master's in web sciences at SVU.
                                        I have good communication skills. I like working in a team. I am very good at the English Language.<strong> I have been working as a web developer for 5 years. </strong>I had a 1-year of experience in CodeIgniter, 2 years of experience in Laravel, and 2 years of experience in WordPress. I also have 2 years of experience in software development with CSSD charity. I have been doing many different jobs outside the software developer but I think they have many benefits. For example, I learned how to coordinate large teams and gained time management skills.
                                        I want to be fluent in web skills in the next year. Seeking a position as a web developer where I can apply for my master’s in Web Science with my five years of experience and use my ability to solve problems in difficult situations.
